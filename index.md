# Hello! 

Hi, welcome to my website! I'm a research engineer at Google working on interpretability and Machine Learning for NLP.

Previously I was a PhD student at [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), where I was advised by [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/), [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and [Khalil Sima'an](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/k.simaan/index.html). 

# Publications

You can find my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VG_wuYkAAAAJ&hl=en) on Google Scholar.

# Short CV

* 2006-2009, BSc in AI, [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/)
* 2009-2012, MSc in AI, [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/)
* 2015-2020. PhD, [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) *Defense planned for October 2020.*
* 2019-Now, Research Engineer, [Google](https://ai.google/).

# Reviewing

I reviewed for the following conferences and workshops:

* ACL
* EMNLP
* CoNNL

* Analyzing and interpreting neural networks for NLP (BlackboxNLP)
* Debugging Machine Learning Models (Debug ML, ICLR Workshop)
* Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT)
* Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP (RepL4NLP)
* Workshop on Structured Prediction for NLP (SPNLP)

# Supervision

During my PhD I supervised the following students:

* Joost Baptist (MSc Thesis)
* Laura Ruis (Honours Project)

# Projects

* [Differentiable Binary Variables](https://github.com/bastings/interpretable_predictions) contains the HardKuma distribution that allows (hybrid) binary samples (with *true* zeros and ones) that allow gradients to pass through.
* [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) is an easy-to-use, educational, and benchmarked NMT toolkit for novices that I developed with Julia Kreutzer. 
* [FREVAL](https://github.com/bastings/freval) is an all-fragments parser evaluation metric that I developed with Khalil Sima'an.
