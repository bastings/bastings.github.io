# Jasmijn Bastings

## Hello

Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Jasmijn (she/they), and I'm a Senior Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I'm interested in the following topics, including (perhaps especially) their intersection:

- Fairness, bias, gender, gender bias, gender-fair language, gender-fair language technology
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Translation (MT), Automatic Translation
- Interpretability, explainability, explainable AI (XAI)

I received my PhD from [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), where I was advised by [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/), [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and [Khalil Sima'an](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/k.simaan/index.html). 

## News

- I'll give a talk at MilaNLP in July.
- I joined the Gender-Inclusive Translation Technologies Workshop (GITT) 2024 organisation committee.
- I'll be at EMNLP 2023 to present [Dissecting Recall of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14767).
- I won an [outstanding Area Chair award](https://2023.aclweb.org/program/best_reviewers/) at ACL 2023!
- June 2023: I will be part of the project "An Interdisciplinary Analysis of gender-based discrimination in Translation Technology", [funded by the Digital Sciences for Society program of Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/current/news/more-news/tilburg-university-invests-digital-sciences-society), a collaboration with [Eva Vanmassenhove](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/e-o-j-vanmassenhove) (NLP/translation), Hanna Lukkari (Law), Seunghyun Song (Philosophy).
- I started a YouTube channel for BlackboxNLP. Check it out and subscibe here: [youtube.com/@blackboxnlp](http://www.youtube.com/@blackboxnlp).
- You can now find me on Mastodon: `@jasmijn@sigmoid.social` or [https://sigmoid.social/@jasmijn](https://sigmoid.social/@jasmijn).

### Blog posts

- [The Annotated Encoder-Decoder](https://bastings.github.io/annotated_encoder_decoder/). Explains implementing RNN-based NMT models in PyTorch.

## Code

* [Interpretable Neural Predictions with Differentiable Binary Variables](https://github.com/bastings/interpretable_predictions) contains the HardKuma distribution that allows (hybrid) binary samples (with *true* zeros and ones) that allow gradients to pass through.
* [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) is an easy-to-use, educational, and benchmarked NMT toolkit for novices that I developed with Julia Kreutzer and is currently maintained by Mayumi Ohta. 
* [FREVAL](https://github.com/bastings/freval) is an all-fragments parser evaluation metric that I developed with Khalil Sima'an.
