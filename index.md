# Jasmijn Bastings

## Hello

Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Jasmijn (she/her), and I'm a Senior Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I'm interested in the following topics, including (perhaps especially) their intersection:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), Artificial Intelligence (AI);
- Interpretability, explainability, explainable AI (XAI);
- Tokenizers and tokenizer-free models;
- Gender, gender bias, gender-fair language, equitable and gender-fair language technology;
- Machine Translation (MT), Automatic Translation, Neural Machine Translation (NMT), multilinguality;

I received my PhD from [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), where I was advised by [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/), [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and [Khalil Sima'an](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/k.simaan/index.html).

### Blog posts

- [The Annotated Encoder-Decoder](https://bastings.github.io/annotated_encoder_decoder/). Explains implementing RNN-based NMT models in PyTorch.

## Code

* [Interpretable Neural Predictions with Differentiable Binary Variables](https://github.com/bastings/interpretable_predictions) contains the HardKuma distribution that allows (hybrid) binary samples (with *true* zeros and ones) that allow gradients to pass through.
* [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) is an easy-to-use, educational, and benchmarked NMT toolkit for novices that I developed with Julia Kreutzer and is currently maintained by Mayumi Ohta. 
* [FREVAL](https://github.com/bastings/freval) is an all-fragments parser evaluation metric that I developed with Khalil Sima'an.
